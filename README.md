## Installation

1 - Clone the boilerplate `ssr` repository.

```
 git clone -b ssr git@github.com:mattcarlotta/Webpack-React-Boilerplate.git
```

2 - Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

3 - While at the application's root directory, start the server by running `npm run dev`.

## Commands

To lint your .js/.scss files, run `npm run lint` while at the application's root directory.

To run your tests, while inside the client's root directory, run `npm run test` or `npm run test:watch`. Testing will watch all your changes in the `.test.js` files as well as create a `coverage` folder. To view the current coverage report, navigate to `coverage/Icov-report/src` and open `index.html` in a browser.

To build and bundle your client resources for production, while inside the client's root directory, use `npm run build` (source maps will be excluded). After you have built your React application for production, use `npm start` while at the application's root directory. You should now see your React application running on `http://localhost:3000`.
